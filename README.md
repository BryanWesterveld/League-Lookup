This site is build using ReactJS and Redux. Unfortunately development has already
stopped. The API provided by Riot Games has changed. Many endpoints were
deprecated and removed to reduce the stress on their servers. Where it was once
possible to query basic information about all matches for a user, one must now
fetch both basic and more detailed information match for match. This makes it
extremely hard to show a list of matches without hurting loading times.
